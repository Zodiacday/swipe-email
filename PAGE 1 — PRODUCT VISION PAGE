1. PRODUCT VISION
1.1 The Core Problem
Email inboxes have become:

Overloaded with newsletters

Flooded with promotions

Filled with low‑value senders

Impossible to clean manually

Emotionally draining

Time‑consuming to maintain

Users feel:

Overwhelmed

Guilty

Out of control

Avoidant

Stressed

The inbox has become a psychological burden, not a communication tool.

1.2 The Emotional Promise
The product promises a feeling, not a feature:

“Your inbox will feel lighter in seconds.”
The emotional transformation:

From chaos → clarity

From guilt → control

From overwhelm → relief

From avoidance → empowerment

From stress → satisfaction

This is not a productivity tool.
It’s an emotional reset button.

1.3 Product Philosophy
1. Fast by Feel
Every action must feel instant, fluid, and frictionless.

2. Emotionally Satisfying
Micro‑dopamine loops through:

Motion

Sound

Color

Feedback

5. Minimal Cognitive Load
One decision per swipe.
One card at a time.
No clutter.

6. Universal Access
Works with all major email providers.
