10.1 Emotional Design Philosophy
1. Emotion > Function
The product’s value is emotional relief, not email management.

Every swipe must feel like a win.

3. Create momentum
Users should feel pulled forward, not pushed.

4. Build identity
Users should feel like “someone who keeps their inbox clean.”

5. Make progress visible
Progress = dopamine.

No guilt. Only empowerment.
